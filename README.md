Notebooks for using [Diff-SVC](https://github.com/prophesier/diff-svc).  
Created by [Nekro Mochi](https://twitter.com/NekroTheCorpse) of Archivoice with help of [Justin](https://github.com/justinjohn0306).  
The inference (or rendering, same difference) notebook is based off of the one provided by Diff-SVC, which isn't made for colab (hence the port).  
These notebooks are made for [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), and may not work on other services (vast.ai, azure, jupyter, kaggle, etc.....)  
You can access the training notebook [here](https://github.com/Archivoice/Diff-SVC-notebooks/blob/main/Diff_SVC_training_notebook_(colab_ver_).ipynb)
