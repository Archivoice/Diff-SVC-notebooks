Notebooks for using [Diff-SVC](https://github.com/prophesier/diff-svc).
Created by [Nekro Mochi](https://twitter.com/NekroTheCorpse) of Archivoice with help of [Justin](https://github.com/justinjohn0306).
As of now (2022/11/13), only the training notebook has been created, with the inference notebook yet to be created.
Additionally, the notebooks are made for [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), and may not work on other services (vast.ai, azure, jupyter, kaggle, etc.....)
You can access the training notebook [here](https://github.com/Archivoice/Diff-SVC-notebooks/blob/main/Diff_SVC_training_notebook_(colab_ver_).ipynb)
